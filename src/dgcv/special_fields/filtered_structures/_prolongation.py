        """
        Computes a number of prolongations above the highest level stored in the current Tanaka_symbol data (starting with the first nonnegative integer, so if highest level is -2, it starts with 0, e.g.), up to the number given in `iterations`. Will stop earlier if stabelization is detected.

        New prolongation levels are stored in the symbols internal data. Can alternatively return a new Tanaka_symbol object with the new prolongation levels stored in its data.

        parameters:
        -----------
            iterations: int
        Determines how many prolongation levels to compute

            return_symbol: bool (optional, default=True)
        If True, the algorithm will return a new Tanaka_symbol object with the new prolongation levels stored in its data. If False returns a dictionary whose keys are level weights and values are corresponding prolongation levels (including all initial levels in the symbol data).

            report_progress:
        Reports progress summaries as prolongations are computed in printed output

            report_progress_and_return_nothing: bool (optional, default=False)
        If True, overides `return_symbol` and `surface_singularities`, reports progress summaries of prolongation in printed output, and returns nothing further.

            with_characteristic_space_reductions: bool (defaults to True if relevant - False if theoretically irrelivant)
        If True and `distinguished_subspaces` was registered in the Tanaka_symbol obj creationg then the prolongation algorithm reduces computed prolongation subspaces to the maximal subspaces allowing the result to be a Lie algebra. This is relavent because if any subspace in distinguished_subspaces has elements of nonnegative weight then the standard subspace-preserving prolongation need not yield an algebra. While this reduction can be geometrically motivated, omitting it permits a less demanding algorithm that will produce a larger prolongation space. A typical application for omitting it would be confirming finite prolongation dimensionality with a less demanding algorithm.

            absorb_distinguished_subspaces:bool (default=False)
        This is relevant when distinguished_subspaces include weighted components of higher weight than the given levels data. In this case those higher weighted components are interpreted as subspaces in a tensor algebra where the theoretical prolongation lives, and on which it also operates. The prolongation algorithm proceeds respecting these in the sense that it honors the axiom that distinguished subspaces are invariant under the action of computed prolongation levels. When absorb_distinguished_subspaces=True, then higher weighted levels are artificially added to computed prolongation levels of the same weight. Setting this to True is only natural in niche geometry motivated contexts, so leaving it as False is likely correct if unsure.

            surface_singularities:bool (optional, default=None)
        If paramater space is empty then this is irrelevant for the prolongation algorithm, but affects the output signature. If True (and not overridden by report_progress_and_return_nothing), additionally returns a list of functions whose zeros are singularities in parameter space found during prolongation. i.e., prolongation will be correct for parameters outside of these singularities. If not set to anything (i.e., left as default None) then when relevant all singularities are still found and saved internally. If set to False then tracking of singularities will be skipped, which may improve the algorithm speed slightly. Note that skipping the tracking does not make the computation parameter-safe: the linear solver still pivots on parameter-dependent coefficients, so the result remains valid for generic parameters, just without a record of where it fails.

            simplify_singularities:bool (optional, default=None)
        Controls simplification of the pivots and singularity ideals produced while tracking singularities. Has no effect when singularity tracking is off (i.e. when surface_singularities=False or the parameter space is empty). Defaults to the `simplify_singularity_ideals_by_default` setting.

            max_report_columns: int (positive)
        This controls the maximum number of columns displayed in the output tables when report_progress is true.

            solve_method: str (optional, default=None)
        The `method` forwarded to every equation solve in the prolongation algorithm. Left as None, it resolves to "linear", except when the symbol carries parameters and singularity tracking is off, in which case it resolves to "linear_parametric" - that case solves systems whose coefficients are unreduced parameter-dependent expressions, which the parametric dispatch handles better. Set it to any method `solve_dgcv` accepts to override uniformly. While singularity tracking is on, a non-linear method is rejected with a warning and replaced by "linear", since divisor collection requires a linear method.

        returns:
        --------
            A Tanaka_symbol object with new prolongation levels stored in its data. Returns a dictionary of unformatted prolongation level data if return_symbol=False.
