    """
    This function serves as the default interface for creating variables within the dgcv package. It supports creating
    both standard coordinate systems and complex coordinate systems, with options for initializing coordinate vector fields
    and differential forms. Variables created through `createVariables` are automatically tracked within dgcv's Variable
    Management Framework (VMF) and are assigned labels validated through a safeguards routine that prevents overwriting important labels (e.g., standard Python built-ins).

    Parameters
    ----------
    variable_label : str
        The label for the primary variable or system of variables to be created. If creating a complex variable system,
        this will correspond to the holomorphic variable(s), whilst antiholomorphic variable(s) recieve this label
        pre-pended with "BAR".

    real_label : str, optional
        The label for the real part of the complex variable system. Required only when creating complex variable systems.

    imaginary_label : str, optional
        The label for the imaginary part of the complex variable system. Required only when creating complex variable
        systems.

    number_of_variables : int, optional
        The number of variables to be created, used to initialize a tuple of variables rather than a single variable
        (e.g., x=(x1, x2, x3) rather than just x).

    initialIndex : int, optional, default=1
        The starting index for tuple variables, allowing for flexible indexing when initializing variable systems
        as tuples (e.g., x=(x0, x1, x2) with `initialIndex=0`).

    withVF : bool, optional (default True)
        If set to True, creates associated coordinate vector fields and differential forms for the variable(s) in the
        system.

    complex : bool, optional
        Specifies whether to create a complex variable system. If not provided, the function will infer whether to
        create a complex system based on whether `real_label` or `imaginary_label` is provided. If provided a complex
        variable system will be created regardless of `real_label` and `imaginary_label` settings, and string labels
        are automatically created for `real_label` and `imaginary_label` if they are not provided.

    multiindex_shape : tuple[int, ...], optional
        If provided, creates a multi-index variable system with shape given by `multiindex_shape`, using index values
        starting at `initialIndex`. For standard systems this creates an N-dimensional array handle stored in the global
        namespace under `variable_label` (or each label if a list is provided). For complex systems, this creates a
        multi-index complex variable system with holomorphic/antiholomorphic and real/imaginary parts.

    assumptions : dict, optional
        This can be a dictionary carrying optional assumptions. Currently supported assumptions are
        {'real':bool, 'nonnegative':bool, 'positive':bool}. Include any of those keys with a boolean value to apply the assumption.

    remove_guardrails : bool, optional
        If set to True, bypasses dgcv's safeguard system for variable labeling, allowing one to overwrite certain
        reserved labels. Use with caution, as it may overwrite important variables in the global namespace.

    default_var_format : {'complex', 'real'}, optional
        Relevant only for complex variable systems. Specifies whether the system's vector fields and differential forms
        default to real coordinate expressions (`real`) or holomorphic coordinate expressions (`complex`). If not
        provided, the default is holomorphic coordinates.

    temporary_variables : bool, optional
        If True, variables are created as temporary variables under dgcv's VMF conventions.

    Returns
    -------
    None or list
        If `return_created_object=True`, returns a list of created handles (for standard systems) or created labels (for
        complex systems, consistent with dgcv conventions). Otherwise returns None.

    Functionality
    -------------
    - Creates standard or complex variable systems.
    - Automatically registers all created variables, vector fields, and differential forms in dgcv's VMF.
    - Safeguards are applied to prevent overwriting critical Python or dgcv internal functions by default.

    Notes
    -----
    - For complex variable systems, dgcv initializes associated differential objects by default.
    - For multi-index standard systems, `withVF=True` is supported and will create VF/DF objects for each atomic entry.
    - For multi-index complex systems, VF/DF objects are created for each atomic entry in the system.
    - Use `vmf_summary()` for a clear summary of variables created and tracked within the dgcv VMF.
